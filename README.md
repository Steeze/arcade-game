###A new take on the classic game of Frogger.

#Rules of the game
1. Move the boy across the board without colliding with a bug.
2. Each successful trip will earn you 10 points and a new level.
3. Each collision will cost you 1 point.
4. The number of enemies you will face correspond to your level.
5. Not unlike old atari games, there is no end to the game, only higher levels.
6. Enjoy!
