     2. Run the command "npm install"
     3. After the node_modules install, type "gulp" then "gulp open" this will open you default browser with the game.

B. If you don't have Node.js installed,

#Rules of the game
1. Move the boy across the board without colliding with a bug.
2. Each successful trip will earn you 10 points and a new level.
3. Each collision will cost you 1 point.
4. The number of enemies you will face correspond to your level.
